### Tiles

***Note**: Warp version shown above, hence the prompt arrow is absent (for this specific terminal).*

## Install

1. Download the `.json` theme file(s) to your local theme directory
2. Update Oh-My-Posh commands in your shell profile to use one (see [official documentation](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize) for details)
3. Enjoy!

## Limitations

Due to the nature of how [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) handles custom prompts, this terminal has its own custom theme files. They are missing decorators for the second prompt line since they are not properly implementable.
